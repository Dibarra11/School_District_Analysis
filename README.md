# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to help analyze PyCity School District standardized test for Math & Reading scores to reveal trends between Charter and Public Schools.

## Summary

Utilizing Jupyter Notebook and Python, several scripts were created to manipulate data to obtain the desired results. When comparing results, we found that all High schools scored higher in Reading (72.36) than in Math (64.68). Furthermore, a significant difference was found in Math scores in Charter Schools compared to Public where all grades expect 12th score higher in Math when attending a Charter School. When analyzing the budget comparison between Charter and public schools, it shows than Charter schools have a lower budget of $38,569.9. Even though Public Schools receive higher funding and have a more significant amount of students in their district compared to Charter schools, Charter schools overall have a higher grade average for both Math and Reading.
